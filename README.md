# Project Title
Custom-Subnet-with-Avalanche-HyperSDK

## Description

This project uses the HyperSDK to demonstrate full control over the rules and functionality of a custom chain, allowing the creation of a custom blockchain that is tailored to a given startup's specific needs. Using the Metacrafters' `tokenvm` repository as starter project, I am able to demonstrate the creation of my custom subnet on which I created, minted and checked my balance of a custom asset.
